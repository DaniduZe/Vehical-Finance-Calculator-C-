# Vehical-Finance-Calculator-C-
This repository contains a C++ program for a simple vehicle finance calculator that uses file handling to store and retrieve data. The program allows users to calculate monthly payments and interest rates for vehicle loans based on user input.

The program enables users to input vehicle cost, down payment, interest rate, and loan term, and calculates the monthly payment and total cost of the loan. The program also stores the user input and calculated results in a text file using file handling, making it easy to retrieve and modify the data later.

The C++ code provides a user-friendly interface for performing vehicle finance calculations and interacting with the stored data. The program is designed to be easy to use and understand, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.

This project is suitable for developers who want to learn about C++ programming and file handling or who want to build a simple vehicle finance calculator from scratch. The program can be easily customized to meet specific business requirements or extended to include additional features.
